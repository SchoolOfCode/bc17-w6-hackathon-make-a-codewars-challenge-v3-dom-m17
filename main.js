/*

*Sum of positives / sum of negatives*

Given an array of integers.

Return an array, where the first element is the sum of positives numbers and the second element is sum of negative numbers. 0 is neither positive nor negative.

Example:
For input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, -11, -12, -13, -14, -15], you should return [55, -65].


If the input is an empty array or is null, return an empty array.

Example:
For input [], you should return []


If the input contains only positive/negative numbers but not both, the function should return 0 in place of the respective sum.

Example:
For input [-1, -2, -3], you should return [0, -6]


For any invalid input (anything that is not an array of numbers), the function should throw an error.

Example:
For input "School of Code", {"Paris": "Olympics"} or [1, [2, 3]], you should throw an error.
